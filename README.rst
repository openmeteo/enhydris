Enhydris is a system for the storage and management of hydrological
and meteorological time series. You can see it in action at
http://openmeteo.org/.

The database is accessible through a web interface, which includes
several data representation features such as tables, graphs and
mapping capabilities. Data access is configurable to allow or to
restrict user groups and/or privileged users to contribute or to
download data. With these capabilities, Enhydris can be used either as
a public repository of free data or as a private
system for data storage. Time series can be downloaded in plain text
format that can be directly loaded to Hydrognomon_, a free
tool for analysis and processing of meteorological time series.

Enhydris is written in Python/Django, and can be installed on every
operating system on which Python runs, including GNU/Linux and Windows.
It is free software, available under the GNU General Public License
version 3 or any later version.
