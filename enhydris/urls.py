# When a user registers, an email is sent, containing a link that the user has to click
# in order to confirm the email. In order to create that link, dj-rest-auth uses
# reverse("account_confirm_email"). So we include that in the urlpatterns, although it's
# not actually being used and should not be served by Django. The web server should be
# configured to route that URL to the front-end, which should then POST to the
# verify-email API endpoint in order to perform the actual verification.

# When a user registers, django-allauth runs reverse("account_email_verification_sent")
# in order to redirect to a page that says "We sent an email verification, click the
# link in that email". In our case, registration is done by POST to an API endpoint,
# which merely responds with "201". However, because something in django-allauth or in
# dj-rest-auth is suboptimal, django-allauth still runs this reverse() (whose return
# value is eventually not used). We therefore add this URL so that the reverse() doesn't
# raise a NoReverseMatch exception. It might have been more correct to fix that in a
# custom django-allauth adapter, but all this is a big mess anyway (see
# https://github.com/Tivix/django-rest-auth/issues/292), so it's not worth it.
